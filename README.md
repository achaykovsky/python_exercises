# Python LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to the Python LeetCode Solutions repository! This project is organized to provide multiple possible solutions for various LeetCode problems, with a focus on Python implementations.

## Project Structure

- **Solutions Directory**: Each LeetCode problem is contained within its own directory, named according to the problem's title in a lowercase, hyphen-separated format (e.g., `two-sum`, `smallest-difference-pair`). Each directory may contain multiple Python files, each representing a different solution approach.

- **`utils` Directory**: You will find a `utils` directory that includes commonly used data structures and utility functions that support the solutions.

- **`create_new_solution.py`**: This utility script is designed to streamline the process of adding new problems to the repository. Running this script and providing the name of a LeetCode question automatically creates a new directory for the problem and generates a `trivial_solution.py` file as a starting point for your implementation.

## Usage

### Adding a New Problem

1. Run the `create_new_solution.py` script.
2. Enter the LeetCode problem name when prompted.
3. A new directory will be created, and a basic `trivial_solution.py` file will be added to the new directory as a template.

### Example

```bash
python create_new_solution.py
```

Enter the problem name when prompted, for example:

```plaintext
Smallest Difference pair of values between two unsorted Arrays
```

This will create a new directory `smallest-difference-pair-of-values-between-two-unsorted-arrays` with a basic `trivial_solution.py` file ready to be edited.
